##  Task Summary

### üñ•Ô∏è System Info
- **OS**: Microsoft Windows 10 (Build 22000.2538)
- **Docker Client Version**: 27.1.1

## Steps Performed

### 1. **Verify Docker Installation**
```bash
docker version
```
- Verified client and server info.

### 2. **Pull Docker Images**
```bash
docker pull ubuntu
docker pull hello-world
```
- Pulled the latest `ubuntu` and `hello-world` images from Docker Hub.

### 3. **Run hello-world Container**
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
- Tested Docker installation. Output confirmed successful setup.

### 4. **List Running and All Containers**
```bash
docker ps
docker ps -a
```
- Verified `hello-world` and older `alpine` containers were present.

### 5. **List All Docker Images**
```bash
docker images
```
- Listed downloaded images (`ubuntu`, `alpine`, `mywebapp`, `hello-world`).

### 6. **Run Ubuntu Container Interactively**
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```
- Accessed bash shell inside the Ubuntu container.
- Exited using `exit`.

### 7. **Remove Specific Container**
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```
- Removed `hello-world` container using container ID.

### 8. **Remove Specific Image**
```bash
